                <p class="card-text">Have you ever wondered why do we combine ingredients in our recipes the way we do? Or for that matter, could we find scientific ways for altering diet to improve health? Our data-driven investigations aimed at probing patterns in traditional Indian recipes, in response to the first question, have led us to the discovery of a novel food pairing phenomenon in Indian cuisine. Our studies have revealed ‘culinary fingerprints’ of regional cuisines and  role of spice as the molecular fulcrum of Indian recipes. Such data-driven explorations of food are opening new avenues for development of divergent applications in the domains of nutrition and health. One such direction is towards application of machine learning for ‘personalized nutrition’ that can potentially answer the second question, thereby allowing us to leverage food as medicine.</p>

We investigated the molecular basis of food composition in the Indian cuisine with rigorous mathematical and computational analysis. We find that the cuisine is characterized with an exceptional food pairing pattern and spices occupy an unique position in rendering this unique food pairing pattern. We are focussing on various ways  we could use the knowledge of such culinary patterns.</p>

It is aimed at chefs and amateur cooks and facilitates generation  of novel recipes by blending characteristic Indian flavors. The app brings the science of molecular gastronomy into the kitchen. In the present form, it allows to explore four categories of Indian recipes: Roti/Naan, Pakoda/Bhajia, Dosa, Idli and Khichadi. We are working on improved strategies to capture the molecular essence of Indian food using artificial intelligence. <i>Credits- Android App Development: Rishabh Bharadwaj; Data analytics and app algorithm: Lavanya Gupa; Discovery: Anupam Jain and Rakhi; Project Lead: Ganesh Bagler</i>
