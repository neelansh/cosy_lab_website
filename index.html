                <p class="card-text">Have you ever wondered why do we combine ingredients in our recipes the way we do? Or for that matter, could we find scientific ways for altering diet to improve health? Our data-driven investigations aimed at probing patterns in traditional Indian recipes, in response to the first question, have led us to the discovery of a novel food pairing phenomenon in Indian cuisine. Our studies have revealed ‘culinary fingerprints’ of regional cuisines and  role of spice as the molecular fulcrum of Indian recipes. Such data-driven explorations of food are opening new avenues for development of divergent applications in the domains of nutrition and health. One such direction is towards application of machine learning for ‘personalized nutrition’ that can potentially answer the second question, thereby allowing us to leverage food as medicine.</p>

                <p class="card-text">India is known to have culinary history of health-centric dietary practices aimed at disease prevention and promotion of health. We investigated the molecular basis of food composition in the Indian cuisine with rigorous mathematical and computational analysis. We find that the cuisine is characterized with an exceptional food pairing pattern and spices occupy an unique position in rendering this unique food pairing pattern. We are focussing on various ways  we could use the knowledge of such culinary patterns.</p>

      <h1>Complex Systems Lab</h1>
      <p>Our research focus is on study of complex systems, primarily of biological origin. We are exploring systems architecture of complex diseases, drug-target networks and brain networks. Broad areas that we study include computational & systems biology, bioinformatics, mathematical modeling, network biology, in silico drug discovery and biomedical data analysis. Apart from modeling and analysis of complex systems, we aim to probe for their control mechanisms and design principles.

        We are associated with <a href="http://ccb.iiitd.ac.in/" target="_blank">Center for Computational Biology</a> at IIIT-Delhi.
