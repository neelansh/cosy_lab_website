description: "The research of Ganesh Bagler (IIIT-Delhi) focuses on study of complex systems, primarily of biological origin. We are exploring systems architecture of complex diseases, drug-target networks and brain networks. The broad areas studied in our lab include computational biology, bioinformatics, mathematical modeling, network biology, in silico drug discovery and biomedical text mining. Apart from modeling and analysis of complex systems, we aim to probe for their control mechanisms and design principles.
He is associated with the Center for Computational Biology."
