description: "The research of Ganesh Bagler (IIIT-Delhi) focuses on study of complex systems, primarily of biological origin. We are exploring systems architecture of complex diseases, drug-target networks and brain networks. The broad areas studied in our lab include computational biology, bioinformatics, mathematical modeling, network biology, in silico drug discovery and biomedical text mining. Apart from modeling and analysis of complex systems, we aim to probe for their control mechanisms and design principles.
He is associated with the Center for Computational Biology."

              I have placed my career foundation in medicine as a Bachelor in Dental Sciences (Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, Faridkot, Punjab) and fashioned myself to be a computational biologist with a M.Tech degree in Bio-Informatics (IIIT-Allahabad). In my masters I dealt with the simulation of miRNA action kinetics using computational bio-informatics which predicted the type of mechanism of action of the sequence. As life being adventurous, I am working on the most adventure seeking organ of human body the BRAIN. The broad theme of my PhD research is systems biological investigations of brain networks. </p>
