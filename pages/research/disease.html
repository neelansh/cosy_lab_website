description: "The research of Ganesh Bagler (IIIT-Delhi) focuses on study of complex systems, primarily of biological origin. We are exploring systems architecture of complex diseases, drug-target networks and brain networks. The broad areas studied in our lab include computational biology, bioinformatics, mathematical modeling, network biology, in silico drug discovery and biomedical text mining. Apart from modeling and analysis of complex systems, we aim to probe for their control mechanisms and design principles.He is associated with the Center for Computational Biology."

  <b>Modeling molecular interactomes underlying complex diseases</b> <br>
  Diseases such as cancers, asthma and diabetes are complex owing to the nature of interconnected underlying molecular mechanisms. We take a rational approach towards modelling these human diseases based on their empirically available data. Our work is rooted in the hypothesis that models of intricate networks of interactions and regulations of molecular mechanisms sufficiently encode necessary information of complex biological processes. We have worked on creating disease protein interactomes, their analysis and identification of targets specific to complex diseases with the ultimate goal of obtaining a set of refined leads of potential therapeutic value, using network biology and in silico drug discovery approach. We believe that our studies would be a valuable addition to the area of systems biology and network medicine.
