description: "The research of Ganesh Bagler (IIIT-Delhi) focuses on study of complex systems, primarily of biological origin. We are exploring systems architecture of complex diseases, drug-target networks and brain networks. The broad areas studied in our lab include computational biology, bioinformatics, mathematical modeling, network biology, in silico drug discovery and biomedical text mining. Apart from modeling and analysis of complex systems, we aim to probe for their control mechanisms and design principles.
He is associated with the Center for Computational Biology."

    <section id="content">
      Many of the natural as well as man-made complex systems are highly organized, extensively networked, and modular in both structure and function. They could be studied with 'complex networks' paradigm with the aim of modeling and understanding their structure, function, dynamics and design. <br><br>
  
<b>Airport Network of India</b> <br>
Aviation infrastructure, with its complex web of connectivity and dynamics over it, presents an interesting case of complex system. 
We analyzed and enumerated the Airport Network of India (ANI), a representative model of Indian's aviation infrastructure system. The study led to some interesting results vis-a-vis world-wide-wide airport network and insights into the dynamic and fast-growing network that ANI is.
It would be interesting to model airport networks aimed at engineering efficient infrastructure, resilience to targeted attacks, and robust against spread of contagious diseases. The last point has especially become important in the light of recent examples of emergence of epidemics such as SARS and swine flu, the global spread of which is largely supported by the aviation infrastructure.<br><br>

 <b>Biological Networks</b> <br>
 With the sequencing of many genomes and advances in high throughput techniques, much information about details of many biological processes as well as macromolecular structures. Graph theoretical paradigm facilitates modeling of these systems as "networks" -- i.e., systems composed of elements interacting among each other in a complex manner. <br><br>
